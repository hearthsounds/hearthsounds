# [Hearthsounds](https://hearthsounds.github.io/)

We made Hearthsounds because one of the things we love most about Hearthstone is the personality of the game.
The visuals and sounds of Hearthstone play a huge role in this and contribute to what makes the game so fun and memorable.
From Taz'dingo to Leeeeeeeeeeeeeroy! we wanted to make a game all around the sounds of the cards when played.
We chose not to include any spells as their sounds aren't unique, 
but we did leave in all the murlocs and dragons for those with astute hearing for the differences between mrglgl's and deep guttural roars. 
So test your skill and Hearthstone sound knowledge, we hope you enjoy our game and may RNGesus bless you in Hearthstone and the favour of the Benevolent Ben Brode always be upon you.
